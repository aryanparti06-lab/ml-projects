# Machine Learning Model for Prediction of Prices of Commodities like Bhindi(Ladies finger), Cabbage, and Mango.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict prices using historical data and machine learning techniques to help in better decision-making.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Description: The dataset contains historical price information and related features.

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Filtering the dataset  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training using Random Forest Regressor  
5. Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, R2 score   

## Models Used
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- MAE: 439.98  
- MSE: 523327.71    
- R² Score: 0.69  

## Visualizations
- Actual vs Predicted values
- Feature importance plot

## Results
Random Forest performed better and produced accurate predictions with lower error values.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how machine learning models can effectively predict prices using historical data and can be extended to real-world applications.
